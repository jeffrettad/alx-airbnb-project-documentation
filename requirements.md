# Airbnb Clone Backend – Requirement Specifications

## 🎯 Objective
This document defines the **technical and functional specifications** for the Airbnb Clone backend.  
It covers **User Authentication**, **Property Management**, and **Booking System**, detailing the API endpoints, inputs, outputs, validation, and performance requirements.

---

## 1. User Authentication

### Functional Requirements
- Allow users (guests/hosts/admins) to register and log in securely.
- Provide JWT-based authentication for session management.
- Support OAuth login (Google, Facebook).

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login` → Authenticate user and return JWT  
- `GET /api/auth/profile` → Get authenticated user profile  
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` → Update user profile details  

### Input / Output Specs
- Input: `email`, `password`, `role`, `name`  
- Output: JWT token, user profile  

### Validation Rules
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, must include letters and numbers  
- Email: Must be unique and valid format  
- Role: Enum → `guest | host | admin`

### Performance
- Login response < 500ms under normal load  
- Concurrent sessions: Support at least **10,000 active tokens**

## 2. Property Management

### Functional Requirements
- Allow hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.
- Store property details: title, description, location, price, amenities, images.
- Enable guests to retrieve listings with filters.

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/properties` → Create property (host only)  
- `GET /api/properties` → Retrieve all properties with optional filters (location, price, amenities)  
- `GET /api/properties/:id` → Get details of a specific property  
- `PUT /api/properties/:id` → Update property (host only)  
- `DELETE /api/properties/:id` → Delete property (host only)  

### Input / Output Specs
- Input: `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `amenities`, `images`  
- Output: JSON object with property details  

### Validation Rules
- Price: Must be a positive number  
- Title: Required, max 100 characters  
- Images: Max 5MB per image, JPEG/PNG only  

### Performance
- Search & filter queries should execute < 1 second  
- Pagination required for large datasets (>1000 listings)

## 3. Booking System

### Functional Requirements
- Guests can book available properties for specific dates.
- Prevent double bookings by validating property availability.
- Support booking cancellation by guest/host.

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/bookings` → Create booking (guest only)  
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` → Retrieve booking details  
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` → Cancel booking  
- `GET /api/users/:id/bookings` → Retrieve all bookings for a user  

### Input / Output Specs
- Input: `propertyId`, `guestId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `paymentDetails`  
- Output: Booking confirmation (status: pending | confirmed | canceled)  

### Validation Rules
- Dates: `endDate` must be after `startDate`  
- Availability: Property must not be booked for requested dates  
- Payment: Must be verified before confirmation  

### Performance
- Booking confirmation < 1 second after payment success  
- Support at least **5,000 concurrent booking transactions**

---

## 🛡️ Security Requirements
- Use **bcrypt** for password hashing.  
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., payment info) using AES-256.  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for guests, hosts, admins.  

## 📊 Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling with load balancers.  
- Monitoring: Centralized logging and error tracking.  
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime SLA.
